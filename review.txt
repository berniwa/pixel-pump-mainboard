Schematic:
Critical:
a) Add a TVS diode to the input
  -> Will fail Surge/ESD testing
  -> I would suggest something like: 
    1) a SMAJ14CA (bidirectional, with the reverse polarity FET) or 
    2) a SMAJ14A (unidirectional) after F1 and without the reverse polarity protection FET
b) Pull the shield to ground
  -> Will fail radiated emissions and ESD Testing (as C21 may blow - depends on the cap)
  -> In practice a capactiviely coupled shield just makes problems
j) Add an input filter  
   -> Will fail powerline coupled emissions testing
   -> Your DCDC converter will most likely not pass Class B emission levels, so you need a filter
   -> A PI filter with 10uF, 10uH, 10uF should be brute force enough
e) Protect and filter footpedal connector 
   -> Will fail ESD and potentially radiated emissions testing
   -> Add a protection TVS and a small ferrit bead + cap to filter +3.3V 
   -> This may be part of your problem, as the 3.3V (with noise) will radiate over the footpedal wire
f) Add series termination
   -> Potentially fails radiated emissions testing
   -> Add some small value (10 - 30Ohm) series resistor, to at least to clock, if you see issue like described
   -> This will reduce reflections and limit higher frequency emissions


Warning:
d) Add filtering to the UserInterface and Expansion ports 
    -> Depending on the cable lengths
g) Use ESD protected FETs
   -> The current FETs you use, have an unprotected gate, what makes them really sensitve for ESD
   -> NX7002 may be an alternative
i) Add protection to the motor port
   -> I don't know the motor, but induktive kickback may cause problems, so addtional protection and filtering may be necessary
   
Question: 
c) You don't need VBUs to easily detect if the device is plugged in?

Layout (just quick, as its late):
a) Add GND on all outer layers
b) Add Via stitching around the board and inside 
    -> The addtional ground will provide addtional shieling and parasitic capacitance against the supply
c) Ignore the 90Ohm diff routing for USB - that isn't necessary for USB 1.1
Generally the frequency you have on the layout are not critical, so you just need to make sure,
that you contain all the interference on the board itself and not couple it to the outside (see schematic)
